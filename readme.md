## Game Play

Go around the house and collect alcohol to smooth the pain but beware of ghosts. They are spooky and are not very comforting. Each time you collect alcohol, your comfort goes up, but when you get spooked, you comfort goes down. Once you are comforted, you must go back to the room and finally relax.
